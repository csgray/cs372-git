# CS 372 - Homework 1: Git Example
1. Created a new repo on GitHub.
2. Created a new directory on my computer, launched PowerShell in it (already configured to support git), and ran “git init” then “git remote add origin https://github.com/csgray/cs372-git.git”.
3. Created “README.md” in that directory (this file) and committed it to the master branch using “git add” and “git commit -m ‘Add README.md’”
4. Pushed to remote repo using "git push -u origin master"
5. Forgot to save so I pushed an empty but new file. Saved, added, committed, pushed actual content.
6. Created a new branch called "merge" with "git checkout -b merge".
7. Added some fluff and committed it.
8. Pushed it to the repo, making a new branch, with "git push --set-upstream origin merge".
